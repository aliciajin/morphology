# Morphology


Data preprocessing


Noor worked on:
1) gen_splits.py -- this file splits up the dataset into train, val, and test sets for use in the binary classification architectures. Written by Noor, collaborated with Yiqian. 

2) Preliminary Method 1 
sperm_classification_baseline.ipynb
Noor modified the sections to upload the sperm data, collaborated with Yiqian.

3) Preliminary Method 3
resnet_alex_vgg.ipynb
v2_resnet_alex_vgg.ipynb
Noor modified sections to upload the sperm data, apply augmentations, change epochs, losses, hyperparameters to assess precision/recall, to review the prediction accuracy and to use tensorboard, collaborated with Yiqian.
